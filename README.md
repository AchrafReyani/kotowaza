# kotowaza (è«º)
A simple lightweight script to display a different wallpaper everytime you login. I made this because I had screenshots of every proverb (kotowaza in Japanese) from the anime Inazuma Eleven but never actually read them so this is a way to see a different one everyday without actively having to open them.

# Instructions 

## Customize the script

### Set the wallpaper folder

Open your `kotowaza.ps1` in a text editor.

Find this line:
```
$wallpaperFolder = "D:\kotowaza" #Replace with your own path/folder of wallpapers
```

Replace `"D:\kotowaza"` with the full path of your own wallpaper folder.
For example, if your images are in `C:\Users\YourName\Wallpapers`, change it to:

```
$wallpaperFolder = "C:\Users\YourName\Wallpapers"
```

### Change the Image format

By default, the script only works for `.png` files.

Find this line:
```
$files = Get-ChildItem -Path $wallpaperFolder -Filter *.png
```

Change the extension based on your wallpaper format. For example if your wallpapers are `.jpg`, change it to:
```
$files = Get-ChildItem -Path $wallpaperFolder -Filter *.jpg
```
